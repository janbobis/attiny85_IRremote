# attiny85_IRremote
The goal of this project is to create a light-weight port of the IRremote library (originally created by Ken Shirriff) for the Attiny25/45/85 microcontroller.

rationale:

1. Several libraries have been created to port the IRremote for the Attiny25/45/85 microcontroller but most of these ports are not fully working
2. Create a more simplified library.
